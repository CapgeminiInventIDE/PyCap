# Welcome to PyCap

## Getting Started

### Instant development environment

To immediately get access to a development environment [click here](https://repl.it/github/CapgeminiInventIDE/PyCap), this should set you up with a repl.it IDE in your browser with all the code in this course. It should look very similar to  the below image.

### Working locally

First ensure you have `git`, `VSCode` and `python` (3.6+) installed, open up your terminal/command prompt and run the following

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Ensure you download Python 3.6+)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Now you're ready to clone the PyCap repo and open it in vscode

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CapgeminiInventIDE/PyCap.git
code PyCap
```
