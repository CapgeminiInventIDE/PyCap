## Become a Mentor
Mentors are required to guide students in their PyCap courses. This typically involves answering questions about Python or the course material, helping debug Python code, designing and assessing CapStone projects, and contributing to the course material. 

As such, mentors should have mastered the basics of Python programming and be able to build functional code for a wide range of mid-level complexity problems. 

You can request to become a mentor for the next PyCap course if you believe you meet the above requirements. 

## Speak on a Special Topic
If there is a Python-based topic that you are familiar with and are passionate about, and that you believe would be interesting or helpful to the class attendees, you can request to host a class on the topic as part of our Special Topics series. These classes are aimed at people who have completed the Introduction to Python course. 

## Write course content
You can request to contribute course content for additional topics that are not already covered in the courses. 


If you would like to contribute in any of these ways, contact Andy Challis at andy.challis@capgemini.com.
